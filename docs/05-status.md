# Status

**Last updated:** 2026-07-28

Phases 1–5 are complete and deployed. Phase 6 (cleanup) has not started, and
several capabilities still live only in the old app.

---

## Done and verified live

Everything below was exercised through the real UI, not by calling endpoints.

### Foundation
- SPA scaffolded, deployed to Cloudflare Pages, auto-deploys on push to `main`.
- Auth: institutional email + 6-digit code, plus a testing sign-in for rostered
  students (refused for instructors).
- Full EN/ES bilingual (~318 string pairs), enforced by a verifier.
- Light/dark theming with OS default and an explicit override.
- Three verifier scripts running in CI.

### Content gating (Phase 2)
- All 23 decks/missions moved to a **private** Supabase Storage bucket as
  single-file HTML.
- The three-hop gated delivery chain works and is guarded by a verifier.
- `GatedFrame` viewer in the app; students only see released content.

### Live class (Phase 3)
- `pulse_rounds` / `pulse_answers`; push / reveal / close / answer.
- Question snapshotted at push; correctness withheld until reveal.
- Hybrid grading into `participation_events` (partial for answering, full for
  correct) — the existing gradebook needed no changes.
- Per-student client-side option shuffling.
- **Verified end to end:** pushed a question, fresh student session received it
  via its own poll with no reload, answered, instructor saw the live count,
  revealed, closed, and the participation row landed in the database.

### Question banks
- 11 lectures × 18 bilingual tiered questions (6 easy / 6 medium / 6 hard),
  generated and imported. 198 questions total.
- `selectQuestions` is difficulty-stratified so a quiz always mixes tiers.

### End-of-class quiz + reflection (Phase 4)
- `course-class-quiz` orchestrates start / close / status / summary /
  reflections / current, reusing the existing activity engine.
- Sequential, per-question-timed player (20s / 30s / 45s by difficulty),
  auto-advance, auto-submit, no going back.
- Reflection: one paragraph, 50–100 words, server-enforced, 5-minute grace
  window after the class closes.
- **Verified end to end**, including running a *second* quiz in the same session
  for a student who had already finished the first and submitted a reflection.

### End the class
- Closes any open question, closes a running quiz, closes the session (which
  stamps `actual_end_at`, the anchor for the reflection grace window). Confirms
  first and names the consequences.

### AI generation pipeline (Phase 5)
- Schema, `course-admin`, PDF upload actions, `course-generation`,
  `course-generation-worker`, deck skeleton + assembler, and the Content screen.
- **Dogfooded on real content**: a PDF built from the professor's own Week 2
  Lecture 2 (Access Control) produced a **33-slide bilingual deck** (126 `data-es`
  attributes) and **18 questions, exactly 6/6/6**, previewed and approved. The
  bank now appears alongside the hand-made ones and is immediately usable.
- The validator caught a real bad generation in the wild ("Q3 has 5 options")
  and the retry produced a valid bank.

## Remaining work, in priority order

### 1. Dress rehearsal with real students on real phones — **highest value**
Nothing here substitutes for it. Only 1–3 test accounts have ever used the
platform, all driven by automation on one machine. Run one complete class.

Watch for: concurrent answer bursts, phones sleeping mid-quiz, students joining
late, flaky campus wifi.

### 2. Re-verify the reflection step on a fresh class session
It worked, and only its polling changed since. But the current test session
already has a reflection submitted, so that branch no longer renders for that
student. **Flagged rather than claimed.**

### 3. Gradebook Tab B — per-class review — **built, NOT yet seen working**
Built on 2026-07-28. A **Per class** tab on the Gradebook screen: pick a class
session, then see every question pushed to the room with its distribution and
correct answer marked, the quiz attempt table with the class average, and every
reflection in full.

Backend: a new `rounds` action on `course-pulse` (all rounds of one session,
batched — `results` is per-round and would have been an N+1). Deployed.
`summary` and `reflections` on `course-class-quiz` were reused as-is; their
return shapes were read directly and match the frontend interfaces.

**Verified:** the `rounds` action is live and role-gated (student → 403, bogus
action → "Unknown action"); typecheck, all three verifiers, and the build pass;
the student surface is unaffected and console-clean.

**Not verified:** the tab has never been rendered. Gradebook is instructor-only
and test sign-in refuses instructor accounts, so no agent can reach this screen
without the professor signing in. **The professor needs to click it before this
counts as done.**

### 4. Admin screens
`course-admin` is built, deployed and tested (create course, invite professor,
list, deactivate) but `/admin` is still a placeholder. Without UI there is no way
to onboard a second professor — which is the whole point of the AI pipeline.

### 5. CSV roster import
People adds one person at a time. Bulk import still lives in the old app.
`course-roster-management` already has `preview_roster` / `apply_roster`.

### 6. Grade adjustments and locking
Backend exists; no UI. Still done in the old app.

### 7. Phase 6 cleanup
- Strip lecture/mission content from the public `mzareei.github.io` repo.
- Point the syllabus at the new app; turn old Gen-2 app pages into redirects.
- Crawl the public site to confirm zero gated-content leaks.
- Gen-1 apps stay frozen.

### 8. Deferred by the professor's own choice
- **QR join code** — `class_sessions.join_code` exists, no UI. Students
  currently reach class through Today.
- **Projector view** — separate big-screen window for pulse results.
- **Mid-slide questions inside the deck** — explicitly "the last thing we do".

### 9. Known wrinkle worth fixing eventually
The generation worker self-chains *and* the Content screen nudges `advance`, so
two invocations can race on one step. Self-healing, but it can write a confusing
transient error. A claim/lease on the job row would fix it properly.

## Closed questions

- **Quiz per-question timing** — asked and answered on 2026-07-28: **seconds**.
  20 / 30 / 45 seconds stays as implemented. Closed; don't reopen it.

## A standing constraint on agent testing

Test sign-in refuses instructor accounts by design
(`course-test-signin/index.ts:128`), and the QA account
`zarei.1982@gmail.com` is student-only — no TA role. An agent can therefore
drive the **entire student side** unaided but **cannot reach any instructor
screen** (Run class, Content, Gradebook, People). Anything instructor-facing
needs the professor signed in at `m.zareei@tec.mx` with an emailed code.

Plan around this: build instructor features knowing the last mile of
verification is the professor's, and say so plainly rather than implying a
screen was seen working.

## How the pipeline was dogfooded (reproducible recipe)

Useful if you need a test PDF again:

1. Chrome headless `--print-to-pdf` on a lecture deck captures **only the one
   visible slide** — deck CSS hides the rest. Don't bother.
2. Instead: parse the deck HTML, extract each `<section class="slide">`'s English
   text (strip `data-es`), emit a plain print-friendly HTML document, then print
   *that* to PDF.
3. For automated testing a minimal base-14 (non-embedded-font) PDF writer keeps
   the file ~7KB — small enough to base64 into the page and attach to the real
   file input via `DataTransfer`, so the actual UI path gets exercised.

Working scratch scripts were used for this and not committed; the recipe above is
enough to recreate them.
